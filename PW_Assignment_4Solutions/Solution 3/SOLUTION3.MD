Web accessibility is the practice of making websites usable by as many people as possible, including people with disabilities.

It is essential to create accessible websites because everyone deserves to have equal access to information and services on the web. People with disabilities use a variety of assistive technologies to access the web, such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, and voice input software. Accessible websites are designed to work with these assistive technologies, so that everyone can have a positive experience using the web.

Creating accessible websites also benefits a variety of other user groups, including:

People with older devices: Accessible websites are often designed to be more lightweight and efficient, which can improve the performance of websites on older devices.
People with slow internet connections: Accessible websites are often designed to be more efficient with data usage, which can improve the performance of websites for people with slow internet connections.
People using mobile devices: Accessible websites are often designed to be more responsive and easier to use on mobile devices.
People with limited English proficiency: Accessible websites can be more easily translated into other languages, which can improve the usability of websites for people with limited English proficiency.
In short, creating accessible websites is essential for creating a more inclusive and equitable web for everyone.
