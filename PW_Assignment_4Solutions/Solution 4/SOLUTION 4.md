### List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML

Here are 3 ways to improve the accessibility of HTML:

- Use semantic HTML elements. Semantic HTML elements are elements that describe the meaning of the content they contain. For example, the **`<h1> `**element is used to represent a heading, and the **`<p> `**element is used to represent a paragraph. Using semantic HTML elements helps screen readers and other assistive technologies to understand the structure of your content and make it more accessible to users.

- Provide alternative text for images. Alternative text, also known as alt text, is a short description of an image. Alt text is used by screen readers to describe the image to users who are blind or have low vision. To provide alt text for an image, use the alt attribute on the **`<img> `**element.

- Use sufficient color contrast. Color contrast is the difference in brightness between two colors. Sufficient color contrast is important for making text and other elements on your web page visible to users with low vision. To ensure sufficient color contrast, use a color contrast calculator to check the contrast between the foreground and background colors of your web page elements.
